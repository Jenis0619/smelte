  Smelte is <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com">Vuetify</a> inspired collection
  of <a href="https://material.io/">Material design</a> components for Svelte
  built with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a>.
  There's only a handful of components at the moment but this project is aimed to grow into
  a powerful UI framework like Vuetify but keeping minimal bundle size thanks to Svelte and Purge CSS.
</p>

<p>
  There's no proper Ã  la carte component distribution at the moment, rather
  this repo can be used as Sapper template.
  It is still very much proof of concept stage, as well as author's ongoing attempt at learning Svelte
  but please feel free to contribute or drop me a line at <a href="mailto:matyunya@gmail.com">matyunya@gmail.com</a>.

<p>
  Tailwind resets much of CSS whereas Smelte tries to bring sensible Material design defaults
  in <a href="https://smelte.matyunya.now.sh/typography">typography</a> and <a href="https://smelte.matyunya.now.sh/colors">color</a>.
