<h2>Hi</h2>
<p class="pb-4">
  Smelte is
  <a class="a" href="https://vuetifyjs.com">Vuetify</a>
  inspired collection of
  <a class="a" href="https://material.io/">Material design</a>
  components for Svelte built with
  <a class="a" href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a>
  . There's only a handful of components at the moment but this project is aimed
  to grow into a powerful UI framework like Vuetify but keeping minimal bundle
  size thanks to Svelte and Purge CSS.
</p>

<p class="pb-4">
  There's no proper Ã  la carte component distribution at the moment, rather the
  <a class="a" href="https://github.com/matyunya/smelte">repo</a>
  of the site you're looking at can be used as Sapper template. It is still very
  much proof of concept stage, as well as author's ongoing attempt at learning
  Svelte but please feel free to contribute or drop me a line at
  <a class="a" href="mailto:matyunya@gmail.com">matyunya@gmail.com</a>
  .
</p>

<p>
  Tailwind resets much of CSS whereas Smelte tries to bring sensible Material
  design defaults in
  <a class="a" href="/typography">typography</a>
  and
  <a class="a" href="/colors">color</a>
  .
