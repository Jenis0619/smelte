<h2>Hi</h2>
<p class="pb-4">
  Smelte is a collection of
  <a class="a" href="https://material.io/">Material design</a>
  components for Svelte built with
  <a class="a" href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS.</a>
  The project was initially inspired by
  <a class="a" href="https://vuetifyjs.com">Vuetify</a>
  , but comes at much lower price. All of this website is only a fraction of
  both JS (670 vs 50 Kb) and CSS (110 vs ~10 Kb) payloads of even the most
  <a class="a" href="https://vuetifyjs.com/en/examples/layouts/baseline">
    basic Vuetify example layout
  </a>
  ), and of course has dark mode.
</p>

<p class="pb-4">
  Tailwind resets much of CSS whereas Smelte tries to bring sensible Material
  design defaults in
  <a class="a" href="/typography">typography</a>
  and
  <a class="a" href="/color">color.</a>
</p>
